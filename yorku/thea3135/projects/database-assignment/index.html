            The question I recieved was 'When is Paul Tillberg going to the Theatre?'.

            <br></br>

            On the construction of my database, I recieved three CSV files containing
            information categorized into three sections. The first being 'Customers', 
            second as 'Orders,' and the third being 'Shows.'
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <br></br>
        
    <p class="pgTxt">
        <span class="bold">Where do these files represent?</span><br></br>

        - 'Customers' in the context of a box office represent individuals who purchased tickets. 
        <br></br>- Linked towards the customer's purchase would be the 'Orders'. 
        This goes into things like the pricing or how many tickets they bought.
        <br></br>- The third file, 'Shows', would be the plays/shows that are running, which would be linked to the tickets/orders.
             
        <br></br>

        <div id="line"></div>
        <br></br>

        <span class="bold">Where did I start?</span><br></br>

        I started by downloading and opening LibreOffice 25.8. From there I created a new Database File by going into
        File -> New -> and clicking on 'Database.' I then proceeded to use the default startup settings and created the file. 
       
        <br></br>
       
        <img class="images" src="file-creation.png" alt="LibreOffice creation of new database file"></img>

        <br></br> 

        <span class="bold">How did I import the data from the CSV files?</span><br></br>

        After creating my database file, I opened all three CSV files (CUSTOMERS, ORDERS, SHOWS) in LibreOffice. I used the default settings when opening the files.

        <br></br>
       
        <img class="images" src="default-csv.png" alt="Default CSV settings"></img>

        <br></br> 

        From there I selected all the columns and rows with data and copied the data into my clipboard. 

        <br></br>
       
        <img class="images" src="csvfile.png" alt="CSV file of 'CUSTOMERS'"></img>

        <br></br> 

        I then went back into my database file and pasted it into the section called 'Tables'. I renamed the table to
        its category (Customers) and then I created a primary key by default after clicking 'Create'. 

        <br></br> 

        <img class="images" src="table-creation.png" alt="Creation of table"></img>

        <br></br> 

        I then repeated this process for the other two CSV files.

        <br></br> 

        After creating the rest of the tables, I edited their values to better match what they represent.
        This was done by right clicking and on the table and clicking 'Edit'.<br></br>
        
        I changed the names of some rows like 'PERSON ID' to 'CUSTOMER ID' or gave unique names to the primary keys. This wasn't neccessarily important however it provides clarity. 
        What did matter however was changing the value type inside the 'Orders' table from [ VARCHAR ] to [ BIGINT ] for Customer ID and Show ID. 
        This is so the database knows it can only accept numbers there.
        <br></br>

        <img class="images" src="big-int.png" alt="Changing values"></img>

        <br>
        
        <div id="line"></div>

        The next step was creating relationships between the tables. To get started, I opened up the tools tab and
        imported my 'Customer', 'Shows', and 'Orders' tables.
        <br></br>

        <img class="images" src="relationship.png" alt="Creation of relationships"></img>

        <br></br>
        I then added my tables. You will note in the screenshot below that the first row in the list of
        tables shows 'ID'. These are the primary keys for each individual table. I however, renamed them by editing
        the tables in the earlier step where I changed the value types for clarity. 
        <br></br>

        <img class="images" src="relationship-tab.png" alt="Creation of relationships"></img>

        <br></br> 

        From there, I started linking my tables to create relationships. I clicked and dragged my primary key from the 'Customers' table 
        towards the matching tab in the 'Orders' table. And I clicked and dragged my primary key from Shows toward the corresponding row in
        the 'Orders' table. From there, my tables are linked and all that's left to do is to create the query.
        <br></br>

        <br></br> 

        <div id="line"></div>
    </p>   
    

    <p class="pgTxt">
        <br>
        <span class="bold">Creating the Query to find when Paul Tillberg is going to the theatre:</span>
        <br></br>
        To create the query, I started by going to the original database file and clicking on the Queries section and
        'Create Query in Design View'.

        <br></br>

        <img class="images" src="query-creation.png" alt="Creation of query file"></img>
       
        <br></br>

        After that I dragged the information I have of Paul Tillberg as well as the information I need from the Tables.
        <br></br>
        I used the table 'Customers' because the main point of information I have was his first and last name. I also used
        the table 'Shows' because the information I needed was under it (Date/Time).
        <br></br>
        Under 'Criterion,' I put in the name 'Paul' under first name and 'Tillberg' under last name. This will return me
        all results under Paul Tillberg, and alongside that, the time he is going to the theatre through Date and Time.

        <br></br>

        <img class="images" src="query-setup.png" alt="Creation of query file"></img>

        <br></br>
        Finally, I ran the Query by clicking F5, and it returned me the results under Paul Tillberg. It also returned
        the dates and times they were going to the theatre.

        <br></br>

        <img class="images" src="results.png" alt="Results of query"></img>

        <br></br>
        In conclusion, this database query tells us that Paul Tillberg is going to the theatre on January 13th, 14th, and 15th @ 8:00PM.
