            The event from my life I chose to write a press release about is the Design Educators Conference.

            <br></br>

            Design educators across Canada gather for the 2026 Design Educators’ Conference at George Brown College in Toronto, right at the start of the month on Thursday, October 1st, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST. Faculty and students from George Brown lead talks and presentations on current approaches to design education, classroom practice, and emerging perspectives. This annual one-day conference invites you to connect with peers and professors to explore and deepen your understanding of various topics related to design education. The event matters now more than ever due to rapid technological changes in the professional design industry and the need for shared strategies across Canadian institutions.
